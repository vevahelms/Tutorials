    "In the field of data science, it is best practice to keep ingested, raw data in its \"purest\" form. A core concept of data management, unmanipulated raw data storage is industry standard for many reasons. First, many programmers and analysts may have access to raw data sources. When multiple programmers have data access, it is important to note that mistakes can easily occur, especally when conducting mundane, repetitive tasks. These mistakes can unwillingly lead to incorrect data manipulation. By safeguarding raw data (i.e., allowing read but not write access to the original data), data integrity is ensured. Additionally, storing raw, unmanipulated data ensures research integrity and replicability. Storing original data allows for future access (i.e., study replication) and double coding processes."

    "\n",
    "1. I think Fowler's first point about diffentiating Data Lakes and data warehouses is important because data warehouses have been around for a long time. By immediately identifying key differences, Fowler both highlights the main advantages of a Data Lake while also educating the reader. In summary, perhaps the largest advantage of a Data Lake over traditional data warehousing is that Data Lakes allow for raw data storage in any form or schema. This allows for data users to utilize data is more realistic ways since data storage isnt limited to a single unified data model. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. I also appreciated how Fowler stressed the importance of clearly documenting the historical source (i.e. time and place) of all data put into a Data Lake. Although Data Lakes represent chaos, managers must promote organized chaos to ensure a historical record. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Lastly, Fowler closes his piece by discussing data privacy and security. As a data analyst who works with large quantities of personally identifiable information (PII), this is an ongoing concern. As my organization works to develop a Data Lake, restricting access to a small group will be crucial. Additionally, as mentioned by Fowler, guidelines regarding accoutability must be established. "

Additionally, the system breaks large files into pieces saved throughout the system - a process that ensures scalability and usability for big data. For example, the system has demonstrated capacity for holding 200 PB of data across a 4,500 machine cluster.\n",
    "2. *Fault-Tolerance*: With a user-friendly interface and easy administrative processes, HDFS is fault-tolerant. The system allows for concurrent access, a key feature for companies with complex data management structure. Lastly, since HDFS acts as a file system, it is rather intuitive. The distributed nature and redundant blocks of data allow for a very high level of fault tolerance.\n",
    "3. *Cost-Effectiveness*: HDFS is integrated with analytical tools, adding the cost-effectiveness of purchasing the system. Additionally, HDFS costs approximately one thousand dollars per terabyte. This translates to approximately 10% the cost of other data management systems. "

Using the provided template (https://gist.github.com/looselycoupled/8f6b0226e92f8e3a13c0), fill in the missing code to get the desired functionality.  When finished, your program should pull the New York Times RSS feed (url is provided) using the feedparser (https://pythonhosted.org/feedparser/introduction.html) library.  Then it should loop through each entry and download the HTML for the article using the Requests library.  Each entry contains a number of attributes - one of which will be the URL for the actual web page.  After the article is downloaded, the program should then save the file to disk. When saving to disk, use the title of the article (from the RSS entry object) as the filename.  Because this string may not be suitable for filenames, a function (slugify) has been provided which takes a string, and then returns a modified version which should be safe to use as a filename.  The \"open\" Python function is used to write data to disk and is well documented.  A common problem with this lab is that the HTML may contain invalid characters (UTF-8 vs ASCII).  To get around this you may need to use something like: \"f.write(content.encode('utf-8'))\"**"

INTERPOL Washington and investigators from the U.S. Marshals Service subsequently determined Gimenez had taken refuge in a safe house situated well within the Spanish speaking community in Miami, where he believed that he could easily acclimatize and blend in.</p>\\n\\n<p>On Friday, at the request of INTERPOL Washington, U.S. Marshals Service personnel from the Southern District of Florida and agents from the Miami office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement - Homeland Security Investigations positively located and identified Gimenez and facilitated his removal from the United States back to Argentina.

In July 1977, Herman was kidnapped at gunpoint by a group of military personnel.\\u201d He was subsequently taken to a clandestine detention center in Buenos Aires where he was \\u201csubjected to repeated mental and physical torture, and relentless interrogation.\\u201d Herman was never again seen alive, and his remains have never been recovered.
